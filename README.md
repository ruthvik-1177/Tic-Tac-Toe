# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic-Tac-Toe game in C involves managing a 3x3 game board where two players take turns marking cells with their respective symbols ('X' or 'O'). The program initializes the board, allows players to make moves, and checks for a win or a draw after each move. Key functions include initializing the board to its default state, displaying the current board, making a move, checking if a player has won, and determining if the board is full. The game continues until a player wins or the board is completely filled, resulting in a draw if no winner is found.
